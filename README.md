## Motivation
In this project, we introduce AI to assess patientsâ€™ condition from a more objective point of view to find standard methods to discriminate normal and DMD stage in order to help doctors to diagnose patients. This project presents a deep learning approach to classify the musclar images of noramal people and patients with DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) images automatically by AI. 

 



## TechStack used


- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


##  Dataset


This dataset consists of __172 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__Normal: 152 images__
*	__DMD: 20 images__

The dataset were collected from the following sources:

* __Myself__ 




## Features
A method to use the dataset to train the classification model by Convolutional Neural Network. Also, we use the test_dataset to do the test and get the good result which we can classify which image is either Normal or DMD precisely

## Results

#### We got the following accuracy/loss training curve plot
